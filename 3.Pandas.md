### Data Input and Output

Pandas can read data or write data from different data sources.  

The 4 main data sources, we normally use are CSV, Excel, HTML and SQL files.

In order to work with HTML files and SQL databases, we need to install the follwing libraries:  

`pip install sqlalchemy`  
`pip install lxml`  
`pip install html5lib`  
`pip install BeautifulSoup4`  

We can install with pip or conda.
