## Recommender Systems

The two most common types of recommender systems are Content-based and Collaborative Filtering (CF).

* Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users' attitude to items, that is it uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items.
* Content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give ypu recommendations based on the similarity between them.
* In general, Collaorative filtering (CF) is more commonly used than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation prespective).  
* The CF algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use.
* CF can be divided into **Memory-Based collaborative Filtering** and **Model-based collaborative filtering**.
