## Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analayze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression anlaysis.

Given a set of training examples, each marked for belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. 

SVM model is a representation of the examples
as points in space map so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.

New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to the category based on which side of that gap they fall on.
