## Principal Component Analysis

PCA is an unsupervised artistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables in order to identify the underlying structure of those variables.  

It is also known sometimes as a general factor analysis.

* Where regression determines a line of best fit to a data set. Factor Analysis determines several orthogonal lines of best fit to the data set.
* Orthogonal just means at right angles.
  * Actually the lines are perpendicular to each other in n-dimensional space.
* n-dimensional space is the variable sample space.
  * There are as many dimensions as there are variables. So in a dataset with 4 variables the sample space is 4 dimesional.
