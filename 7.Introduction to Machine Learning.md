## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. 

Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples such as an input where the desired output is known.

For example, a segment of text could have a category label, like:
* **Spam** vs. **Legitimate** Email
* **Positive** vs. **Negative** Email

### How it works?

The network receives a set of input data along with the corresponding correct outputs and then the algorithm or network will learn by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.     
Then it will modify the model accordingly such as adjusting the weights and biased values in the network.

* Supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data predicts likely future events.
