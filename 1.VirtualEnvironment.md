## Virtual Environment

Virtual Environments allow to set up virtual installation of python and libraries on our computer.  
We have can multiple versions of Python or libraries and easily activate or deactivate these environments.

For Example: 
When we want to program in different versions like we develop a program using one version and if next version of the librray has been released, we need to check whether our program code works using next release or not. 

To create an environment:  
`conda create --name <NewEnvironmentName> <basepackage>`

To create an environment with a specific python version:  
`conda create --name <NewEnvironmentName> python=<VersionNo> <basepackage>`

To activate a virtual Environment:
`activate <VirtualEnvironmentName>`

To deactivate a virtual Environment:
`deactivate`
