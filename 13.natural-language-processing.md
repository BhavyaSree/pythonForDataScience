## Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) serves lot of usecases when dealing with text or unstructured text data.  

Example:
* we have two documents
  * "Blue House"
  * "Red House"
* Featurize based on the word count
  * "Blue House" -> (red, blue, house) -> (0,1,1)
  * "Red House" -> (red, blue, house) -> (1,0,1)  
A document represented as a vector of word counts is called a "Bag of words"
* We can improve on Bag of words by adjusting word counts based on their frequency in corpus (the group of all the documents)
* We can use TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
* Term Frequency is the importance of the term within the document.
  * TF(d,t) = Number of ocuurences of the term t in the document d
* Inverse document frequency is the importance of the term in corpus.
  * IDF(t) = log(D/t) where  
    * D = total number of documents
    * t = number of documents with the term   

For natural language processing install nltk library.

`pip install nltk`
