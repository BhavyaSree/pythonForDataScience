## NumPy

NumPy is a linear algebra library for Python. Almost all the libraries in the PyData ecosystem rely on NumPy as on of their main building blocks. 

NumPy is incredibly fast,as it has bindings to C libraries.  

### Install

## NumPy Arrays

NumPy arrays are of two types:
* vector - 1-d arrays
* matrices - 2-d arrays
Still, matrices can have only one row or on column (which can be of vector type)
