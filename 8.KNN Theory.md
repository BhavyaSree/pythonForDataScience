## KNN Theory

K Neartest Naighbours is a classification algorithm.

#### Training Algorithm
1. Store all the data

#### Prediction Algorithm
1. Calculate the distance from x to all points in our data
2. Sort the points n your data by increasing distance from x
3. Predict the majority label of the 'K' closest points

k indicates the number of nearest neighbours to the new point.

If k=3, our prediction of the new point can be different from when we chose k = 5

For larger values of K, we can get the clear cutoff or result.

#### Pros
* Very simple
* Training is trivial
* Works with any number of classes
* Easy to add more data
* Few parameters - K and distance metric

#### Cons
* High prediction cost (worse for large data sets)
* Not good with high dimesional data
* Categorical Features don't work well
