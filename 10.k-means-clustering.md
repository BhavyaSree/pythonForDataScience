## K Means Clustering

K Means Clustering is a unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to group similar clusters together in your data.  

Typical clustering problem looks like 
* Cluster similar documents
* Cluster customers based on features
* Market segmentation
* Identify similar physical groups

The overall goal of K means clustering is to divide data into distinct groups such that observation within each group are similar.  

The K means Algorithm:
* Choose a numnber of clusters 'K'
* Randomly assign each point to a cluster
* Until clusters stop changing repeat the following.  
  * For each cluster, compute the cluster centroid by taking the mean vector of points in the cluster.
  * Assign each data point to the cluster for which the centroid is closest.

### Chossing a K value

* There is no easy answer to choose best 'k' value
* One way is the elbow method

First of all, compute the sum of squared error (SSE) for some values of K (for example 2,4,6,8 etc.).  

The SSE is defined as the sum of the squared distance between each member of the cluster and its centroid.

If you plot K against the SSE you will see that the air decreases as K gets larger, this is because when the number of clusters increases they should be smaller.So distortion is also smaller.

The idea of the elbow method is to choose the K at which the SSE decreases abruptly.This produces an elbow effect in the graph.
